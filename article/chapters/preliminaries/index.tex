\subsection{Structure of the Document}

The remainder of this document is organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In this chaper we will delve into the fundamentals of blockchain technology, examining its
    mechanisms, benefits, and limitations, focusing on the Bitcoin network as a case study.

  \item In chapter \ref{chap:federated-learning} we introduce federated learning. As a preliminary, we
    propose a very basic introduction to machine learning in \ref{sec:supervised-learning}, which
    introduces some topics and terminology relevant to federated learning. Then we proceed to explore the
    workings of the original federated learning proposal in \ref{sec:vanilla-fl}.
  \item In chapter \ref{chap:integration} we explore the possibility of integrating the two technologies.
    First we explore advantages, challenges and existing solutions in \ref{sec:blockchain-fl}. Then we
    proceed to present our implementation and our unique views on how to solve some challenges in
    \ref{chap:implementation}.
    We then evaluate our implementation against vanilla federated learning in \ref{chap:evaluation}.
  \item Finally we sum up the key findings and insights of this document in \ref{chap:conclusion}.
\end{itemize}
